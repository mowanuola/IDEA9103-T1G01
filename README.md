Group work: As a team, we will be working to create an abstract representation of Piet Mondrian's Boogie Woogie

Individual work: To integrate random seed, I created an interaction where the rectangles within the artwork continually evolve and interact. Some rectangles change colour gradually, guided by Perlin noise, resulting in a unique backdrop every second calculated with the noise function and incorporating the frameCount. Overlaid on the grid are lines that move and adapt based on the same noise pattern, adding some more complexity. The animation also responds to user input, allowing them to toggle between different states.
